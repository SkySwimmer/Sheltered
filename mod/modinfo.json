If you press DOWN while interacting with the creature they will remain where they are.\n\nNOTE: this mod just launched and needs proper testing, while dev testing looked good i would not recommend using this mod in your main saves until it is fully tested and stable.\n\nSource code: https://github.com/SkySwimmer/Sheltered\nIf you are not using steam, prebuild binaries can be found on the github.",
